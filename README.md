# source engine chat spam config generator

Usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/ReactiioN1337/source-chat-spam-cfg-generator
cd source-chat-spam-cfg-generator
npm install .
```

Then start the script with `node index.js` to create the configuration file. After this has been created, you can edit it with a text editor (preferred: Sublime Text 3). When you have finished editing, restart the script with `node index.js` to convert the configuration file into an "output.cfg" file.
